FACTCHECK_AI_RESPONSE="Factcheck the following statements as of latest data: '{market_outlook_narrative_str}':
1. **Identify statements:** Make sure that statements are not misleading, incorrect, or lack sufficient evidence from data that are available as of {current_date}.
2. **Return a JSON object**: JSON with the following structure:
2.1 Key [factcheck] with value as string 'accurate' if the response is accurate, or 'inaccurate' if any issues are found, even with one issue it would be considered 'inaccurate'.
2.2 Key [issues] as an array of strings, where each string describes a specific issue found in the response and based on what date. If no issues are found, return an empty array for [issues]."

SECTOR_ROTATION_LONG_ONLY_PROMPT="[prompt]"
REGIONAL_ROTATION_LONG_SHORT_PROMPT=[prompt]"
FX_LONG_SHORT_PROMPT="[prompt]"
</pre>

**Model [prompt] must contain some of the following information:**

- Tickers: `{ticker_str}`,
- Current date: `{current_date}`,
- Sector Region: `{sector_region_str}`,
- Regional Region: `{regional_region_str}`,
- FX Region: `{fx_regions_str}`,
- Geopolitical: `{geopolitical_weight}`,

- Technical/Sentiment: `{technical_sentiment_weight}`,
- Liquidity: `{liquidity_weight}`,
- Earnings: `{earnings_weight}`,
- Business Cycle: `{business_cycle_weight}`,
- Sentiment Surveys: `{sentiment_surveys_weight}`


**Model [prompt] should return the following JSON as well:**

```
{
  "title": "string, concise journalist-ready title (~12 words, explicit drivers of price)",
  "market_outlook_narrative": [
    "string, first paragraph: key catalysts, events, indicators, or data driving market movements",
    "string, second paragraph: how these factors impact pricing, provide support or weigh on market",
    "string, third paragraph: forward-looking view, upcoming events, indicators, outlook"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "ticker": "string, ETF ticker from most suitable to least suitable for investment",
      "trade_direction": "string, either 'long' or 'short' based on bull_bear_score",
      "bull_bear_score": "integer, 1-10 reflecting bullish/bearish strength"
    },
    {
      "ticker": "string",
      "trade_direction": "string",
      "bull_bear_score": "integer"
    }
  ]
}
```
To return the JSON, include the following line in the prompt:
<pre>
**JSON Output format:** Return your final recommendations in the following JSON format only, using this exact structure: [title] as a string, [market_outlook_narrative] as an array of strings, and [recommendations] as an array of objects, where each object includes [ticker] as a string, [trade_direction] as a string, and [bull_bear_score] as an integer.
</pre>

The JSON output will be interpreted by the Alphagora engine, which will then process, transform, and securely store the data for further analysis and use within the system.
