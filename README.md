# Alphagora
Alphagora is a framework that leverages generative AI to analyze a wide spectrum of information, including market data, economic indicators, and sentiment signals from news and social media. By integrating these diverse inputs across asset classes â€” from equities and commodities to metals, FX, and ETFs â€” it identifies trends and generates precise investment and trading recommendations, with the goal of achieving absolute returns. Built on the belief that collective sentiment drives market direction, we are developing a framework that incorporates industry and academic best practices from our research to identify and capitalize on these patterns.
