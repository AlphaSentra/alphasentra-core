2025-10-26 17:42:28,300 - ERROR - [ERR-0001] - [ad7f3c64] Failed to parse AI response: Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves that operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee worldwide, offering coffee, tea, other beverages, food products, and licensing its trademarks.

**Sector:** Consumer Discretionary

**Fundamental Analysis:**

*   **cashflow_health:** A
    Starbucks demonstrates strong cash flow health, with net cash provided by operating activities reaching $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2024 and operating cash flow of $4.901 billion in the latest twelve months (ending June 2025). Its cash flow to current liabilities stood at 66.2% in FY 2024 and 52.2% in the latest twelve months, indicating sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations. Additionally, the company's debt is well covered by its operating cash flow (28.3%), and it maintains healthy cash and short-term investments of $4.5 billion.

*   **profit_health:** C
    Starbucks' profit health shows some areas of concern despite overall revenue growth. For fiscal year 2024, the company reported an operating margin of 11.55% and a net profit margin of 9.12%. However, in Q3 FY25 (ended June 29, 2025), the GAAP operating margin contracted significantly by 680 basis points year-over-year to 9.9%, attributed to deleverage, investments in its "Back to Starbucks" plan, and inflation. Furthermore, GAAP earnings per share (EPS) fell 47% year-over-year in Q3 2025. This indicates a challenging environment with increasing costs and competition impacting profitability, particularly in North America where operating margins slid by 770 basis points year-over-year in Q3 FY25.

*   **price_momentum:** D
    Starbucks' stock price momentum is currently weak. As of October 24, 2025, the stock price was $86.09, showing a slight increase of 0.76% in the past 24 hours and 3.24% over the last month. However, it has declined by 11.87% over the last year and is down approximately 5% year-to-date (as of September 8, 2025), underperforming the S&P 500. An external analysis from October 13, 2025, assigned Starbucks a grade of D for momentum, citing a weighted relative strength of -9.3%, which signifies weak momentum. The current price is also trading below its 100-day and 200-day simple moving averages, and is closer to its 52-week low than its 52-week high.

*   **growth_health:** C
    Starbucks' growth health presents mixed signals, with recent challenges in comparable store sales. Consolidated net revenue for fiscal year 2024 increased by 11.7% to $36 billion. In Q3 FY25, consolidated net revenues grew 4% to $9.5 billion. However, global comparable store sales declined 2% in both fiscal year 2024 and Q3 FY25, driven by a decrease in transactions. Specifically, North America comparable store sales declined 2% in Q3 FY25, although China comparable store sales saw a 2% growth in the same period. The company is adjusting its expansion strategy, including halting new cafe openings and closing some existing stores, due to declining same-store sales. Despite these challenges, Starbucks is implementing a "Back to Starbucks" turnaround plan, focusing on operational efficiencies and wellness-driven innovations like protein cold foam, which saw a 23% surge in sales in Q3 2025, suggesting potential areas for future growth. | Exception: JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) | From: analysis.py:run_analysis()
