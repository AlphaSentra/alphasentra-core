2025-11-01 14:03:05,431 - ERROR - [ERR-0001] - [4311ffc4] Failed to parse AI response: PPL Corporation is an energy company that generates, transmits, and distributes electricity and natural gas to millions of customers across its regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Rhode Island.

**sector**: "Utilities"

**cashflow_health**: "C" - PPL demonstrates consistent operating cash flow, with projected growth and management's confidence in maintaining a healthy FFO/debt ratio of 16-18% through at least 2027. However, its debt is not entirely covered by operating cash flow (13.5%), and short-term assets currently do not cover short-term or long-term liabilities, indicating some liquidity concerns.

**profit_health**: "B" - PPL exhibits solid profit margins, with a gross profit margin of 42.84% as of Q2 2024, and operating and net profit margins of 12.40% and 10.47% respectively for late 2024/early 2025. The company reported a 19.89% increase in earnings in 2024 and has grown earnings at an average annual rate of 12.8% over the past five years, outperforming the electric utilities industry. While Q2 2025 ongoing earnings saw a slight dip due to timing and weather, the full-year 2025 forecast remains strong.

**price_momentum**: "B" - PPL's stock price has shown positive momentum over the past year, increasing by 15.59% and outperforming the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLU) 11.4% uptick, though it slightly underperformed the broader S&P 500 Index's 16.2% return over the same period. While there have been short-term dips (down -3.92% in the last 10 days as of late October 2025), analysts generally have a "Buy" consensus rating with an average price target forecasting an approximate 8.94% increase over the next year.

**growth_health**: "A" - PPL projects robust long-term growth with targets of 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth through at least 2028, expecting EPS growth to be in the top half of that range. The company plans significant infrastructure investments of $20 billion from 2025 to 2028, supporting an average annual rate base growth of 9.8%, and is strategically positioned to benefit from the increasing demand from data centers. Additionally, PPL has demonstrated strong historical revenue growth, with a 5.3% increase over the past year and a 14.8% three-year growth rate. | Exception: JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) | From: analysis.py:run_analysis()

The sector breakdown for the NASDAQ 100, according to GICS, as of October 31, 2025, is primarily driven by Technology at 65.94%, followed by Consumer Discretionary at 17.27%, Health Care at 4.38%, Industrials at 3.38%, Telecommunications (Communication Services) at 3.38%, Consumer Staples at 2.31%, Utilities at 1.44%, Materials (Basic Materials) at 1.28%, Energy at 0.46%, and Real Estate at 0.15%; the index excludes Financials with 0.00%.

It is not applicable to assign A-F grades for "cashflow_health", "profit_health", and "growth_health" directly to an index like the NASDAQ 100, as these metrics are typically evaluated for individual companies. However, price momentum can be assessed for an index.
